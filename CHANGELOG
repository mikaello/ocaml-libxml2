OCaml-bindings to libxml2

* ocaml-xml 0.0i (2008-11-28)

Rename the archives.  Since one archive has been called libxml2.a by
ocamlmklib, linking native binaries only worked accidentially, if the
installation directory is in the linkers search path.

Remove libxslt bindings from this package.

* ocaml-xml 0.0h (2008-10-02)

Add missing implementation for xml_reader_next.
Rename xml_writer_write_dtd_content to xml_writer_write_dtd_element to make
it work.

* ocaml-xml 0.0g (2008-04-30)

Warn if we find an older version of ocaml-libxml2.
Distribute a spec file.

* ocaml-xml 0.0f (2008-02-21)

Adapted the spec file to the fedora packaging guide lines.

* ocaml-xml 0.0e (2007-08-21)

Corrected configure.ac again for Mac OS X.  Correction suggested by
John Billings <jnb26@cam.ac.uk>.

* ocaml-xml 0.0d (2007-08-14)

Made installing the shared object of the library optional, since some
platforms do not support building the shared object.

* ocaml-xml 0.0c (2007-06-29)

Changed license to GPL 3 and integrated some corrections to the build
system to integrate better with findlib.

* ocaml-xml 0.0b (2007-06-20)

Simplifications and building PIC.

* ocaml-xml 0.0a (2007-03-05)

Prerelease with creolcomp 0.0a with some error corrections.
